You fret at the sight of the flaming arrows geared towards you. Not much time is left. You wriggle like mad to get out of the ropes. No use. The wet ropes hold you tighter than might have dry ones. Of the barrage of flame tipped arrows, a few brush past you while most miss you by a large margin. As the rope sets on fire, your strugle becomes less in vain. Perhaps the fire is weakening the ropes. You strive harder and harder and, voila! In a swift move, the ropes come off, and you fall a short distance to the floor. The whole place is burning, and you salvage what you can and run away. There was only one path, probably the one by which you were brought in, so no confusion. >woundedPlay
You know you've committed a lot of sins. Having no idea why or how you are here, you still decide to accept your death. There is only one who could have judged you. And it is God. You accept whatever He gives, even death, for your sins. As your thoughts fade, the ropes catch fire. A gruesome death for you, but you are no more sad as you've accepted this. You don't die an unsatisfied spirit. Your spirit rests in peace. /
Even in unknown surroundings, your skillls do not fail you. You are experienced enough to know that the ropes, once they catch fire, will weaken, providing for you, an escape. With high focus, you concentrate and wait for the first arrow to reach your ropes. As the rope ignites, a quick movement, a swift evasion, and you are out of the ropes in no time. You feel good. Your skills haven't rusted. Yet. You find some treasure on the ground, and only one path in the distance, so no confusion. A smile spreads across your face. No day is a bad day. >skilledPlay
