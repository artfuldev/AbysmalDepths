Opening your eyes, you see you're all tied up. To your left, three tied up exactly like you are. And one more to your right. The place seems vaguely familiar. Yes, you've seen the place. But you can't remember. A spot of light on the top tells you you're deep underground, but nothing else. No visiblility in the cavern except for the diffuse sunlight reflected by strange rocks that fill the walls. Not too bright to please the eye, but bright enough to make things out.
What happened? Why were were you there? And tied up? You're too tired to think. You wonder why. Whatever could have happened in your life to get you here!
A mild breeze whiifs out the strong scent of kerosene. You notice your ropes are wet and dripping. Why? Will you be burned? What have you done? >chooseHero
