The voice interrupts your deeper thoughts.
"You still alive? I hope so. The other three buggers don't seem to be in a talkative mood. Like, that's gonna stop them from being killed!"

"I need a name, mate. Can't be seen to be talking to a nobody, now, can I? People might think I'm one of the loonies." >chooseClass
