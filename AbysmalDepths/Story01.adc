Seeing the searing arrow gets to you and you try to wriggle out of the ropes holding you back. It hurts your wrists and feet like hell but you don't give up.The arrow moves too swiftly for you. It touches the rope and the rope sets on fire. Desperately fighting death which lay ahead if you stopped moving, you wriggle out just as the rope gets weakened due to the fire. A few burns here and there, but what the heck! You're still alive.>Story02
You know what this is all about. You've committed a grave sin and you've thought of this very day all your life. You've wanted this more than all of them. Those that imprisoned you and are now waiting to kill you. This is what you've always wanted. A moment of peace and tranquil. A sacred and wise decision. Repentance and Absolution. Thoughts are too slow compared to the searing arrow. Your memories fade as you resign to your death. It comes too soon, but no sooner than you are satisfied with your last breath./
Years of experience has thought you better. You are sharper than the arrow, for everything you know. Making unnecessary movements will only drain the little energy you think you have left. As the glow of the fire gets closer, with one swift move, you make the tip touch the rope. As the rope gives in to the fire, you untangle yourself. Unscathed, you are content that your skills haven't eluded you. Yet.[c >Story02
