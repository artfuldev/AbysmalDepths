Seeing the searing arrow gets to you and you try to wriggle out of the ropes holding you back. It hurts your wrists and feet like hell but you don't give up.The arrow moves too swiftly for you. It touches the rope and the rope sets on fire. Desperately fighting death which lay ahead if you stopped moving, you wriggle out just as the rope gets weakened due to the fire. A few burns here and there, but what the heck! You're still alive.

You know what this is all about. You've committed a grave sin and you've thought of this very day all your life. You've wanted this more than all of them. Those that imprisoned you and are now waiting to kill you. This is what you've always wanted. A moment of peace and tranquil. A sacred and wise decision. Repentance and Absolution. Thoughts are too slow compared to the searing arrow. Your memories fade as you resign to your death. It comes too soon, but no sooner than you are satisfied with your last breath.

This is the third choice. You have done well to have picked the third choice. This is just a test.
