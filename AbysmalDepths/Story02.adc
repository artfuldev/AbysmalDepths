You don't find the need to look around or wait. The only thing in your mind is to get out of whatever this place is. Again a monotonous hallway. Whatever this place is or was, its been in this unused state for a long time, you gather. Cobwebs hanging everywhere, strange insects and sounds moving away once the light enters their unreclaimed space of darkness.+
As you turn with the torch in your hand to show light to the rest of the room, you look at the strange signs in the walls. The bookshelf is in the distance but you can make out a few books. A corner still remains dark. As you try to illuminate the corner, a snake appears out of nowhere and strikes at you. As youc ome back to your senses, you realize you've been poisoned. Nothing can save you from your fate, it seems.>GameEnd
There are several books in the bookshelf, one interests you. 'Prophecy' by Erumollien Calanon. It has the text:"Thyself will read this book; Thyself will have this look; Thyself will let events unfold; Thyself will suffer miseries untold." A lot more symbols and text of bad omen are found. You skim through and find nothing of interest. You proceed through the door. Cobwebs hanging everywhere, strange insects and sounds moving away once the light enters their unreclaimed space of darkness.>ArcEnd
