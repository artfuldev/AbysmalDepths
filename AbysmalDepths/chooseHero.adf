As you show light to the dimly lit area of the new hallway, on the right, something catches your attention. A lot of symbols on the walls with undecipherable handwriting. But one thing is for certain. It is about you. It has your name on it. And who you are. And how you came here. You can make out your name clearly, but ther rest is in some illegible mass of text and symbols. Maybe you need to know some other language to be able to read that. You find yourself nervous after reading your name there.
